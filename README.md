Karma counter - README
Overview
Karma Calculator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python and Tkinter that simulates the game of Shotgun Roulette. This application helps track the number of live and blank rounds in the game, displaying real-time statistics such as the remaining rounds and their respective percentages. It also includes features like inverting live and blank rounds, restarting the game, and toggling the window's always-on-top status.

Features
Set Rounds: Input the number of live and blank rounds to start the game.
Track Status: Displays the number of live and blank rounds and their percentages.
Shot Live Round: Decrease the number of live rounds when a live round is shot.
Shot Blank Round: Decrease the number of blank rounds when a blank round is shot.
Invert Rounds: Swap the number of live rounds with blank rounds.
Restart Game: Reset the number of live and blank rounds to zero and restart the game.
Always On Top: Toggle the application window to always stay on top of other windows.
